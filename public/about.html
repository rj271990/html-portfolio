<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a seasoned Full Stack Web Developer with expertise in all programs and technologies associated with web development. My proficiency spans front-end frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, as well as back-end technologies including Node.js, HTML, CSS, Java, and PHP. I am well-versed in the full spectrum of full stack development tools, including JavaScript, TypeScript, databases like MySQL and MongoDB, cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure, and modern DevOps practices like CI/CD pipelines and containerization with Docker. Whether it's crafting responsive, visually appealing designs with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or building robust server-side applications with Java and Node.js, I excel at creating scalable, secure, and user-focused digital solutions.

Beyond web development, I am a proven entrepreneur with a track record of launching and scaling successful businesses. I founded and operated multiple ventures, including Fix-A-Fone, Boost Mobile, Metro-PCS, Flavor Street Wear, and Phones and Smokes. Through strategic vision and hands-on leadership, I set up each business, drove their growth, and ultimately exited them for a profit. My entrepreneurial journey reflects my ability to combine technical expertise with business acumen, delivering results in both the digital and commercial landscapes.</p>
